# Energy Efficient Trajectory Planning in Ocean Environments using CoSTA

Matlab code for multi-agent enery efficient trajectory planning in uncertain ocean currents. The approach uses a novel recursive momentum-based accelerated successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm named Constrained STORM Successive Convex
Approximation (CoSTA) Algorithm.
